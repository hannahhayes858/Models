```{r}
#Loading ggplot package and lopading library
library(ggplot2)
pie_crab %>% ggplot(aes(x = latitude, y = size)) + geom_point() + 
# Make the y-axis include 0
   ylim(0, NA)
```

#### Q1.1

Yes there does appear to be a linear positive trend where as latitude increase size does as well. There seems to be a lot of variation, but does follow a gradual increase. We do not feel very confident, but we do believe there is a trend, but whether it is significant we are not entirely sure.

#### Q1.2

```{r}
pie_crab %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Latitude, y = Size, color = air_temp)) + 
  geom_point()  +  
  ylim(0, NA) 

```
